# Changelog

All notable changes to ED Colony Tracker.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-04-27

### Added
- **War & Peace tab** (new feature) — find systems in conflict (War / Civil War / Election) within radius of a reference system. Filters by state, system allegiance, combatant allegiance, min population. Server proxies Spansh's systems-search API; results cached per BGS tick (Thursday 07:00 UTC). Reference defaults to commander's current system.
- **Scout button** on each War & Peace row — fetches Spansh + EDSM in parallel for the system, builds a synthesized scout report (conflict pairs with allegiance tags, combat anchors with refuel/repair/rearm icons, full-service stations sorted by distance, notes when multiple simultaneous conflicts are present). Persisted in `scoutedConflicts[systemAddress]` until next BGS tick.
- **Sources page economy filter** — multi-select chip row beneath the search box. Cross-references `knownStations[].economies[]` so users can find e.g. all known Industrial surface settlements they've docked at.
- **Sources page travel time** in Browse Market Data system mode — pulls from `stationTravelTimes` keyed by current ship's shipId, with current-dock → FC → last-dock fallback chain. Format: `3:49 via FC`.
- **Dock-info banner** (overlay) — fires on Docked event, supplements the existing welcome stack with: economy line (top 1-2 economies with mixed/single indicator), noteworthy services line (Cartographics, Factors, Tech Broker, Material Trader with Raw/Manufactured/Encoded type derived from system economy heuristic, Black Market), and an "Established by you on YYYY-MM-DD" line for stations completed via colonization projects.
- **Server-side append-only guard** — `marketSnapshots`, `knownStations`, `knownSystems`, `systemAddressMap`, `bodyVisits`, `bodyNotes`, `fleetCarriers`, `fleetCarrierSpaceUsage`, `visitedMarkets`, `journalExplorationCache`, `scoutedSystems`, `stationTravelTimes`, `scoutedConflicts` are now protected from client-side `__remove` PATCH operations. Logs `[State] BLOCKED N __remove ops on append-only key 'X'` when a misbehaving tab tries to wipe data via stale-baseline diff.
- **30-second SSE watchdog** — when no SSE traffic (heartbeat or event) has been received in 45s, force a full state rehydrate. Catches silent SSE death on iOS without needing user interaction.
- **SSE reconnect → forced rehydrate** — `EventSource.onerror → wasErrored=true → next onopen runs forceStateRehydrate('sse-reconnect')` so missed events during the disconnect window are caught up immediately.
- **27 colonization commodities mirrored to server-side dictionary** (`server/journal/commodities.js`) — they were added to the client-side dict in v1.3.0 but missed on the server, causing FC market reads to store raw `$xxx_name;` IDs instead of canonical IDs.
- **Carrier-cargo backfill** — `pollCompanionFiles` walks all carrierCargo entries on each tick and rewrites broken `$xxx_name;` commodityIds to canonical form using the now-complete dictionary. Logs once per tick where corrections occurred.

### Fixed
- **`fleetCarriers` partialize bug** — was in `MERGE_STRATEGIES` but missing from `partialize`. Every Sync All triggered a `BLOCKED 9 __remove ops on fleetCarriers` because the client serialized state without fleetCarriers, then `computeStateDiff` thought baseline-but-not-current meant "remove all FCs". Now persisted.
- **Spansh `reference_system` case sensitivity** — Spansh's name search is case-insensitive but `reference_system` is case-sensitive (`aleumoxii` → 400). Server proxy now resolves to canonical case via name lookup before querying.
- **Cavallo Nero / Chiang Bastion misclassified as fleet carriers** — `isFleetCarrierMarketId` used a `marketId >= 3,700,000,000` threshold guess that false-positived every player-built station with a high marketId. Replaced with a runtime FC registry seeded from `knownStations` (10 confirmed FCs) and updated on every Docked-as-FC event. Threshold guess removed.
- **`applyStatePatch` write race** — was reading existing state from disk before merging the patch, which meant two patches landing within the 500ms write debounce stomped each other's `pendingState`. Now reads `pendingState ?? readStateFile()`. This was the cause of Cavallo Nero's 141-item snapshot getting overwritten by the inferior 2-item Sync All snapshot.
- **Cancel pending `setItem` on rehydrate** — the 300ms-debounced setItem could fire AFTER a server-initiated rehydrate, computing a diff against the new baseline using the OLD store state and emitting `__remove` for everything the rehydrate just brought down. Rehydrate now cancels any pending setItem timer.
- **Sync All currentMarket arm overwriting comprehensive snapshots** — old code had its own restrictive filter (sell-side only, dictionary-gated). Now delegates to `pollCompanionFiles` so all snapshot creation goes through one path.
- **Sources / Browse Market Data**: distance rounded (no decimals), stock displays as `309K` / `1.2M`, dropped ` cr` from prices and ` ls` from arrival distances, travel time as `3:49 via FC` on a single nowrap line, removed the cluttered `visited` tag text + checkmark (pinned still shows ⭐).
- **War & Peace radius input** — backspace works (was snapping back to 100 when cleared). Distance display rounded to integer ly. Reference field no longer auto-resets to current system after the user clears it.
- **Companion FC banner "as of Invalid Date"** — `carrierCargo` entries written by `pollCompanionFiles` were missing the `updatedAt` field. Added; CompanionPage falls back to `latestTransfer` for legacy entries.
- **Snapshot `stationType` was always empty** — `pollCompanionFiles` hardcoded `stationType: ''` even though `Market.json` carries the actual type. Now uses the real value.
- **`visitedMarkets` → `marketSnapshots` migration on Sync All** — eliminates the render-time merge fragility where a snapshot getting filtered by `isEphemeralStation` would unexpectedly fall back to the inferior journal-only data.

### Changed
- **Single source of truth at render time**: SourcesPage now reads only from `marketSnapshots`. Migration backfills journal-derived stubs on Sync All.
- **Material Trader heuristic in dock banner**: type derived from system primary economy (Industrial → Manufactured, Extraction/Refinery → Raw, High Tech/Military → Encoded). Vista Genomics dropped from noteworthy services list (too common).

## [1.3.2] — 2026-04-26

### Changed
- **Fleet Carrier page copy** — every label now makes it explicit that the page tracks **sell orders set in the in-game Commodities Market**, not raw FC inventory. Subtitle, count badge, empty state, and section headers (`Relevant Sell Orders` / `Other Sell Orders`) updated. Cargo physically on the carrier without an active sell order won't appear here, and the UI now says so.

### Added (diagnostics)
- **Server-side SSE logging** in `broadcastEvent` and the `/api/events` connect/disconnect handlers. Every non-heartbeat broadcast prints `[SSE] broadcast <type> source=<src> → N client(s)` to the exe terminal; connect/disconnect prints client count too. Lets us see in real time whether events are reaching iPad/PC tabs.
- **Client-side SSE echo** — store SSE listener POSTs every received event to `/api/log` so it surfaces in the exe terminal as `[StoreSSE] received <type> source=<src>`. Used for diagnosing the "FC tab not auto-updating" report.

## [1.3.1] — 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- **Fleet Carriers tab not auto-updating** — the page copied `carrierCargo` into local React state on mount and only repopulated it on Refresh click. Now it's derived from the zustand store via `useMemo`, so any server-side write (journal Cargo.json tick, `/api/refresh-companion-files`, docked-at-FC auto-read) propagates through SSE → store → UI with no manual tap. iPad finally behaves.
- **Projects tab not auto-updating from journal depot events** — `state_updated` SSEs from the server-side watcher were being swallowed by the 2-second `PATCH_IGNORE_WINDOW` intended for the client's own patches. Now the window is bypassed for server-initiated sources (`watcher`, `sync-all`, `refresh-companion-files`, `sync-market`).
- **Stale state served during the 500 ms debounce window** — `GET /api/state` read straight from disk while writes were pending, so SSE-triggered rehydrates on other clients could pull pre-patch data. Now returns `pendingState` when available and falls through to disk only when flushed.
- **Garbled commodity IDs from broken regex** — `resourceToCommodity` used the character class `[$;_name]` which removed literal `n`/`a`/`m`/`e` letters along with the delimiters ("Evacuation Shelter" → `vcutioshltr`). Fixed to `/^\$|_name;?$/gi` in both `server/journal/extractor.js` and `src/services/journalReader.ts`.
- **ProjectDetailPage dropping commodities with garbled stored IDs** — pre-fix data still lives in saved projects. Display now falls back to matching by display name when the stored `commodityId` isn't in the dictionary.

### Added
- **27 more colonization commodities** in `src/data/commodities.ts`: Building Fabricators, Surface Stabilisers, Structural Regulators, Robotics, Mineral Extractors, Crop Harvesters, Auto-Fabricators, Geological Equipment, Emergency Power Cells, Evacuation Shelter, Survival Equipment, Land Enrichment Systems, H.E. Suits, Combat Stabilisers, Micro Controllers, Battle Weapons, Military Grade Fabrics, Advanced Catalysers, Microbial Furnaces, Resonating Separators, Thermal Cooling Units, Basic Medicines, Bioreducing Lichen, Muon Imager, Biowaste, Grain, Pesticides.
- **Depot event diagnostics** in the exe terminal — `processDepotEvents` now prints one of `[Depot] Updated N project(s)…`, `[Depot] Skipped N: …`, or `[Depot] N depot event(s) but no projects exist — ignored` so future auto-update regressions are diagnosable without DevTools.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- **Market.json capture:** station snapshots were silently dropped when the station sold only non-colonization commodities (e.g. Chiang Bastion's military market with Hydrogen Fuel / Scrap / Weapons) or had 0 matches after the dictionary lookup. Now captures every item Market.json lists, falls back to raw Spansh names when not in the dictionary, and always saves the snapshot so station metadata is preserved even for zero-commodity cases.

### Added
- **POST /api/sync-market** endpoint — routes through the same `pollCompanionFiles` used by the 5 s watcher, so the Sync button behavior is identical to automatic capture.
- **Sync Market button** now prefers the server endpoint, falls back to client-side File System Access API for browser-only mode.
- **In-game overlay messages** on successful saves:
  - "Market captured: {Station} — N items"
  - "FC cargo updated: {Callsign} — N items"
- **Wiki page** (`/wiki`) with reference tables for the 700 ly scouting bubble around Col 173 Sector AX-J d9-52:
  - Atmosphere rarity including vs excluding icy bodies (18 atmo types)
  - Dramatic-sky geometries (ring edge, inside rings, binary pairs, big sibling)
  - Notable individual systems (Carbon star HIP 52656, Hot Silicate Vapour landables)
  - Star & ring rarity stats + rare body type counts
- **FSSDiscoveryScan** (honk) now updates `commanderPosition` — fills the gap when you haven't jumped/docked recently.
- Market snapshots now include optional `sellPrice`, `demand`, `category` fields on the `PersistedMarketCommodity` type, enabling future "where to sell" features without another schema change.

### Changed
- Sources page filters snapshot commodities to sell-side (`stock > 0 && buyPrice > 0`) at render time, so buy-side data captured by the new storage path doesn't pollute the "find where to buy" view.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-20

### Added
- **Server-side journal reader port** — journal watcher, parser, extractors, and overlay all moved from browser File System Access API into the Node/SEA server. iPad and Surface now get full functionality hands-off; no more "only Chrome on the gaming PC can read journals" limitation.
- **Sparse PATCH persistence** — client now diffs state vs baseline and PATCHes per-key with merge strategies (map / arrayById / set / replace). Eliminates cross-tab clobber races when multiple devices edit state simultaneously.
- **Unified commanderPosition** — `syncCommanderPosition(source, name, addr, coords?)` is the sole entry point for location updates. Tagged with source + updatedAt + broadcast via SSE `commander_position` event. Companion page shows `via <Source>` badge.
- **Sync All** button on the Dashboard — no longer gated behind Chrome-only File System Access API detection.
- **Fleet Carrier refresh** button on FleetCarrierPage now works from iPad (uses server `POST /api/refresh-companion-files`).
- **Dock dossier preservation** — three-way merge (prior + kb.stations + dockHistory) prevents bare `__upsert` wipes on Location events.
- **Permanently-ephemeral station filter** — FC + Trailblazer only. Construction-site docks are now tallied against the eventual MarketID, so post-build station visit counts are correct.

### Fixed
- `commanderPosition` getting stuck on a stale system after jumping elsewhere (sync-all wasn't calling `fetchLatestPositionFromJournal`).
- FC titanium / carrier cargo not propagating from `Market.json` to `carrierCargo` during sync-all.
- Sources page showing raw commodity IDs like `insulatingmembrane` instead of display names (`COMMODITY_BY_ID[id]` bracket-access on a Map was always undefined; fixed to `.get(id)`).
- Dock welcome overlay showing wrong visit count ("2nd visit" instead of actual 208) when `processKBEvents` fired without preserving existing dossier.
- Travel time on Sources page falling back incorrectly when current station had no trip data — now falls back to Fleet Carrier, then last-docked station, with "via FC" / "via last dock" badges.
